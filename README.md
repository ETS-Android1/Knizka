Kni≈æka
==========

<b>open-source</b> software aimed to have useful prayer book application.

The project is based on Omni-Notes project developed by Federico Iosue. More info about Omni-Notes can be found https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes

The project was inspired by the absence of such applications. It aims to provide an attractive look and follow the most recent design guidelines of the Google operating system.

**Follow the developments and post your comments and advice on Github**

## Features

Currently the following functions are implemented:

* Material Design interface
  *Basic add, modify, archive, trash and delete prayers actions
  
* Share, merge and search prayers

* Image, audio and generic file attachments

* Manage your notes using tags and categories

* Sketch-prayer mode

* Notes shortcut on home screen

* Export/import notes to backup

* Google Now integration: just tell "write a prayer" followed by the content

* Multiple widgets, DashClock extension, Android 4.2 lockscreen compatibility

  

You can find a complete changelog inside the application settings menu!

### Forking project

When forking the project you'll have to modify some files that are strictly dependent from my own development / build / third-party-services environment. Files that need some attention are the following:

  - *gradle.properties*: this is overridden by another file with the same name inside the *Knizka* module. You can do the same or leave as it is, any missing property will let the app gracefully fallback on a default behavior.

## Dependencies

They're all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I'd like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:
